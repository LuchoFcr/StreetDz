An open source of a car simulation project i was working on a few months ago, realistic physics and car behaviour, various scenes, fbx models, paid assets, etc. It isn't finished but maybe i can help someone.

it was made for android devices being cautious with the draw callbacks, lights, etc
uses fmod for vehicle sounds.
